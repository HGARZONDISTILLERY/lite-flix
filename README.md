### Additional Comments
- I added a @ts-nocheck in the AddMovieModal since there is a TS error when adding the custon Icon prop.
- I left comments in the Add Movie modal component in order to track the information stored in the database.
- The area to load the file is from the Dropzone component. Its a little bit different than the design and I liked it since is more user friendly (the area to drop the file is bigger).
